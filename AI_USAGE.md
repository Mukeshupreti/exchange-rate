## AI Tool Usage Declaration

ChatGPT was used as a supplementary development aid during this code
challenge.\
It supported architectural validation, best practices discussion, and
debugging guidance.\
All core implementation, business logic, API design, and final decisions
were written and reviewed manually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Prompts / Questions Asked

- How to design a resilient exchange rate microservice (DB + external
  provider)
- Best practices for Circuit Breaker and Retry in Spring Boot 3
- How to structure pagination and DTO mapping properly
- How to handle validation and global exception handling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Relevant AI Guidance

AI helped validate:

- DB-first strategy with external fallback
- Use of Resilience4j for fault tolerance
- Pageable for large dataset handling
- Structured error handling approach

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Ownership

All AI suggestions were reviewed critically.

- Architectural decisions were manually validated
- Business logic was implemented independently
- Some suggestions were modified to better fit the requirements
- No code was blindly copied without understanding

AI was used as a productivity and validation assistant --- not as an
automated code generator.
